Data and code for "CircCNNs, a convolutional neural network framework to better understand the biogenesis of exonic circRNAs"

The figure below shows the rationale of how we created exon pairs that either participate in back-splicing (BS) to form exonic circRNAs or linear-splicing (LS) to form linear transcript. Our CircCNNs framework is then based on this curated dataset to classify between the BS and LS exon pairs.

The figure below shows our base models processing the junction sequences to classify BS and LS exon pairs.
